The software is provided "as is" as a set of MATLAB resource files and is 
tested under MATLAB version 7.5 (R2017b).

Required toolboxes:
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

Execute the file DFCC.m to process an example of a U2OS nucleus expressing H2B-GFP. 
The processed file can be easily changed by setting the appropriate directory (full 
path including filename and extension). 

The example data takes ~1h 40 min on following system:

      Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700IQ CPU @ 2.60 GHz 2.60 Ghz     
      16.0 Gb RAM
